[TUM NST](https://www.nst.ei.tum.de/) LED board for [eDVS](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/nst/programming/edvsgettingstarted) calibration and other purposes

## Setup
The board uses an LPC176x processor. Development is done using NXP's [LPCXpresso IDE](https://www.lpcware.com/lpcxpresso) with its integrated toolchain.

In the IDE, make sure the **CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx** "example" project is open. Otherwise the compiler will find unresolvable includes.

## Run
Flash the program using the integrated debugger.
